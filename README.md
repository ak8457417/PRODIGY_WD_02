TASK 02
STOPWATCH WEB APPLICATION

Stopwatch Project: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

In this project, I developed a fully functional stopwatch application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to create a minimalist yet intuitive interface with enhanced functionality, allowing users to easily start, stop, reset, and track time efficiently.

For styling, I used CSS3 to create a clean and modern look, while ensuring that the layout was responsive across different devices. The interface includes a visually appealing display with distinct buttons for controlling the timer, optimized for user experience.

On the functionality side, I utilized JavaScript to handle the core timing logic, implementing features such as start/stop functionality, reset button, and time intervals. Additionally, I ensured smooth transitions and animations, providing a polished feel.

This project was a great learning experience, reinforcing my skills in JavaScript event handling and CSS animations. Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and growing with Prodigy Info-Tech, and Iâ€™m looking forward to taking on even more complex challenges in the future! ðŸš€
